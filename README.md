# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Analyzes text files and gives you word counts and character frequency stats.

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```

## What it does

- Counts total words
- Counts each character (case-insensitive) 
- Sorts characters by frequency
- Shows alphabetical characters only
